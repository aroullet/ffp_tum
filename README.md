# FFP TUM

## Installation
This project uses the external library SDL2 to create a GUI. 
For Debian-based operating systems, install them with the following command:\
```sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libsdl2 libsdl2-image```
For other platforms, refer to this link: https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation

## Notes
* In the doc folder you will find a UML class diagram which
you can use to have a quick overview of the components.
The contents of the remaining folders should be self-explanatory. 




* The user is not asked to input a number of timesteps as the program will keep running unless closed by the user 
or the system.
